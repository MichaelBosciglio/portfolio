I officially embarked on my journey in software engineering at the University of Ottawa, where I pursued a Bachelor of Applied Science in my Software Engineering CO-OP program. Throughout my academic tenure, I delved into various subjects including Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Software Requirements Analysis, and Software Design and Architecture. During this time, I worked in four professional settings, gaining practical experience in the software development life cycle."

I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence in software development. My tenure at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada equipped me with valuable insights into web application development, project management, and compliance standards within various frameworks. My dedication to advancing my skills is reflected in my personal projects, such as my capstone project, the Mouse Accessibility Attachment Proteus and TrackBite, showcasing my proficiency in React, Python, Java, SQL, and other essential programming languages."
